Hi, world. My name's Alysha. I like food, games, and basking in the cold sweat of my existential crises. Pizza is fantastic. There is no inherent good or evil. Only you can give meaning to your life. If you choose to follow a lobster in the sky to do so, do it, so long as you aren't hurting anyone. If you choose to gorge yourself on pizza, I wouldn't blame you.
